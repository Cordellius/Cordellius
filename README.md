### Hello, My name is Cordellius!
I am 16 and I go to Beecher High School. I am a beginner and coding and don't know too much about it.
I'm looking forward to learning more about coding and maybe eventually I'll become a professional coder. When I was younger, I used to see people make their own games and I always wanted to try and make my own game so that's another thing I'm looking forward to.

-🔭I'm currently working on my first Github README

-💻This is my first time taking a coding class ever

-🏀I enjoy playing basketball and video games

-🏫I have maintained a 3.0 or higher GPA

-💬I can be asked about anything and you will get a honest and valid response from me

-🤔Something I'm looking for help on is my number/guessing game assignment I have to do

-📚I'm currently learning how to add emojis to text
